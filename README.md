- Anthropic API key ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lethal350/leashnet-pipedrive-webhook.git
cd leashnet-pipedrive-webhook
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your Anthropic API key:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

Or export it directly:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Usage

### Interactive CLI Mode (Recommended)

The easiest way to use the agent is through the interactive CLI:

```bash
python cli.py
```

#### Available Commands:

- `diagnose` or `d` - Start a new diagnostic session
- `continue` or `c` - Continue current conversation
- `maintenance` or `m` - Get maintenance schedule
- `upgrades` or `u` - Get upgrade recommendations
- `reset` or `r` - Reset conversation and start fresh
- `export` or `e` - Export conversation to JSON file
- `help` or `h` - Show help message
- `quit` or `exit` - Exit the program

#### Example Session:

```
Command: diagnose
Problem description: My prints have gaps between the layers

Printer model (e.g., Ender 3 Pro): Ender 3 Pro
Filament type (e.g., PLA): PLA
Nozzle temperature (e.g., 200): 200
Bed temperature (e.g., 60): 60

[Agent provides diagnosis and solutions]

Command: continue
Your message: How do I calibrate e-steps?

[Agent provides step-by-step e-steps calibration]

Command: export
Filename: my_diagnosis_2024.json
✓ Conversation exported to my_diagnosis_2024.json
```

### Python API Usage

You can also use the agent programmatically in your own Python scripts:

```python
from agents.printer_maintenance_agent import PrinterMaintenanceAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = PrinterMaintenanceAgent()

# Diagnose a problem
response = agent.diagnose(
    user_query="My prints have gaps between layers and look weak",
    context={
        "printer_model": "Ender 3 Pro",
        "filament": "PLA",
        "nozzle_temp": "200°C",
        "bed_temp": "60°C"
    }
)

print(response)

# Continue the conversation
followup = agent.continue_conversation(
    "I'm a beginner. Can you explain how to do a cold pull?"
)

print(followup)

# Export conversation history
agent.export_conversation("diagnostic_session.json")

# Reset for new session
agent.reset_conversation()

# Get maintenance schedule
maintenance = agent.get_maintenance_schedule()
print(maintenance)

# Get upgrade recommendations
upgrades = agent.get_upgrade_recommendations(use_case="print quality")
print(upgrades)
```

### Running the Example Script

The main agent file includes example usage:

```bash
python agents/printer_maintenance_agent.py
```

This will run through several example scenarios:
1. Diagnosing under-extrusion
2. Follow-up question about cold pulls
3. Getting a maintenance schedule

## Agent Capabilities

### Diagnostic Approach

The agent uses a systematic diagnostic process:

1. **Symptom Analysis**: Understands the described problem
2. **Root Cause Identification**: Identifies most likely causes
3. **Multiple Solutions**: Provides ranked solutions by likelihood
4. **User-Appropriate Instructions**: Adapts communication to user's skill level
5. **Follow-up Support**: Answers questions and guides through repairs

### Common Problems Handled

| Problem | Symptoms | Example Causes |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Under-Extrusion** | Thin layers, gaps, weak prints | Clogged nozzle, wrong e-steps, low temp |
| **Bed Adhesion** | First layer not sticking | Unlevel bed, wrong Z-offset, dirty surface |
| **Layer Shifting** | Offset layers, skewed prints | Loose belts, loose pulleys, speed too high |
| **Layer Shifting (CoreXY)** | **Diagonal** shifts/skew | Unequal belt tension, belt desync |
| **Stringing** | Thin strings between parts | Poor retraction, temp too high, wet filament |
| **Clogs** | No extrusion, clicking | Partial clog, heat creep, debris |
| **Quality Issues** | Blobs, zits, ringing, VFAs | Speed/accel settings, mechanical issues |
| **Binding/Grinding** | Resistance, noise when moving | Over-tightened eccentric nuts, worn wheels |
| **Power Issues** | No power or intermittent | Failed PSU, blown fuse, mainboard voltage regulator |
| **Sensor Failures** | BLTouch won't deploy/trigger | Wiring (C7 capacitor), firmware config, pin stuck |
| **Heat Creep** | Clogs above melt zone | Insufficient cooling, all-metal hotend issues |
| **IDEX Misalignment** | Dual colors don't line up | Tool offset miscalibration, thermal expansion |

agent.load_conversation("session_2024_01_15.json")

# Reset conversation for a new issue
agent.reset_conversation()
```

### Custom Context

Provide detailed context for better diagnosis:

```python
context = {
    "printer_model": "Ender 3 V2",
    "firmware": "Marlin 2.0.9.3",
    "filament": "eSUN PLA+",
    "nozzle_size": "0.4mm",
    "nozzle_temp": "215°C",
    "bed_temp": "65°C",
    "print_speed": "50mm/s",
    "retraction": "6mm @ 45mm/s",
    "previous_attempts": "Tried releveling bed, cleaned nozzle"
}

response = agent.diagnose("Prints have elephant's foot", context=context)
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

If you get `ValueError: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be set`:

```bash
# Set temporarily (current session only)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Set permanently (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Import Errors

If you get import errors, ensure you're in the correct directory and virtual environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/leashnet-pipedrive-webhook
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Rich CLI Not Available

The interactive CLI uses the `rich` library for enhanced formatting. If not installed, it will fall back to basic text output. To get the full experience:

```bash
pip install rich
```

## Dependencies

Core dependencies:
- `anthropic` - Claude API client
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management

Optional dependencies for enhanced features:
- `rich` - Enhanced CLI interface with colors and formatting
- `flask` - For building web interfaces
- `click` - For advanced CLI features
